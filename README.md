# One Game Design
One game design. How games / video games are designed, from a newbie point of view.

# Motivation

One game design is a personal project in which I'll try to discovered, based on a very short experience, how games (board games, social games) and videogames are designed. 

Also, I'll try to keep a tight schedule: one game design every two weeks, starting on January's 3rd week.

Every content will be shared, under open source license (see License), in this Github repository. Probably, it will include some kind of blog, and every content designed every two weeks.
