This is week 1803 game progress log. Please, visit About page for more info, or go directly to [Github Repository](https://github.com/mdblabs/onegamedesign).

## Day 1

This is OGD first day, first game! I built a short backlog ([Github's Kanban Board #1803](https://github.com/mdblabs/onegamedesign/projects/1).

Also, I used [Cowface's Random Title](http://www.cowfacegames.com/) generator, which is based on LDJAM old themes.

I followed a similar voting schema like the use on LDJAM. 
* First I selected 10 random titles, whithout any filter.
* Then, I voted every single theme from 1 to 10.
* I selected the 3-4 more voted, and voted again.
* I selected the winner.

In this case the winner was.... DeepSpace!

Ok, I know what you are thinking... As I'm doing this alone, and while this is the first game, I tried to be as realistic as possible, trying not to apply any bias over voting, and so on.
 
Votes are defined by just personal experience: easy to develop, funny creative theme, etc.

Here you are random picked themes, vote results and winner table.

Tomorrow I'll work on game mechanics. It was an easy start!
